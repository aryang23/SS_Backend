Q. What happens before?
1. Data Redundancy
2. Data inconsistency
3. Difficult to data access
4. Security
6. Data Concurrent Access -> How 2 persons will be able to access the data


Database is nothing but a shared collection of data

Then managing systems was hard

Then DBMS was there
Database Management systems

They help us to create, fetch and maintain data in Database

Database is just a collection of data

Problems they solve
1. Control Data Redundancy(Faltu Data) -> Normalization which helps in solving that a lot

2. It helps us to put constraints

3. Maintains Restriction of unauthroized access

4. Easy Backup and Recovery Functionality

Data Redundancy can lead to Data Inconsistency


Database Management Systems

RDBMS
Relational Database Management Systems which maintains data in form of tables

We store data in form of tables
EG. MySQL, PgSQL, Oracle SQL, Sqlite

SQL Standards

SQL => Structured Query Language

New Language to interact with Databases

SQL is Declarative Language => We don't tell how to do something, we tell what we want to do
We don't write logic, we write what we want to do

MySQL is a software
SQL is a language that MySQL will be going to support
But It might not support all the features
So, It's based on Softwares


Anyone of DB well


MySQL Very Simple, Quite Scalable and Good Community Support
